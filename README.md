# The Rustdoc Field Guide

an "interactive" tutorial to demonstrate how to read rustdoc-generated documentation

There are a lot of little tricks in rustdoc that people often don't know. There's a ["How to read
this documentation"][std-how] in the std docs, but it's easy to overlook and doesn't explain
everything in the rustdoc layout. So i'm taking it upon myself to write a guide that's as exhaustive
as i can muster, so we can document *even more* things that rustdoc does.
